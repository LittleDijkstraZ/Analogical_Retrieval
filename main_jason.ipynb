It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

      "A. John had been born into a well-to-do family, inheriting a fortune so large that it was often incomprehensible even to him. He owned luxurious penthouses in cities renowned for their exuberance and affluent life. The company he inherited from his father was a multi-billion-dollar business empire, earning him the title of a billionaire. John, it seemed, was an epitome of prosperity and success. And while many looked at his life with a tinge of green in their eyes, everyone envied his wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "John's life was extravagant, filled with parties, fast cars, and the finest of wines. His dinners consisted of the rarest delicacies catered by celebrity chefs, and his holidays were in the most sought-after tourist destinations. His days were filled with business, while his nights were filled with entertaining high-profile guests. John was living the proverbial dream, or so it seemed to those looking from the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite such a luxurious life and seemingly endless wealth, he yearned for something else. Every time he looked at his reflection in the gold-framed mirror, he couldn't help but feel a pang of loneliness. John was surrounded by people, by admirers, by business partners, but he felt utterly alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike most, John's problems didn't revolve around money; instead, they revolved around the gaping void in his life, void that his wealth couldn't fill. He had no true friends, no family, and no one who genuinely cared for him beyond his fortunes. He had no one to share his victories with, no one to lean on during his failures. His riches were a magnet that attracted the people around him, but his heart yearned for a connection that was more human and less materialistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the sun set behind his luxury yacht, he stood there, a solitary figure amidst a sea of opulence. He had everything that money could buy, but he yearned for that which money couldn't afford - companionship, genuine relationships, and true love. He realized that despite being one of the richest men in the world, he felt poor. Poor in affection, poor in companionship, poor in all the aspects that made life worth living.\n",
      "\n",
      "John's wealth was a blessing and a curse. It attracted envy, but also isolation. He was rich beyond measure, but was a destitute in matters of the heart. He was living a life many could only dream of, yet his heart was crying out in solitude. John was a man surrounded by people, yet he was utterly alone.\n",
      "B. Once upon a time, in the busy city of New York, a young man named Jack lived a life of simple contentment. Jack was a small town lad, who had moved to the bustling city in pursuit of his dreams. He had always aspired to be a successful businessman, undeterred by the amount of hard work and dedication it would require.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, he walked past a bustling storefront, its window glittering with a display of shiny trinkets. Among them was an ornate golden watch, its lustrous appeal drawing Jack towards it. Being an ambitious man, Jack thought that possessing the golden watch would give him an essence of opulence and success. Ignoring his meager savings, he walked into the shop and purchased the beautiful timepiece.\n",
      "\n",
      "Days turned into weeks, and Jack flaited the golden watch proudly. He noticed that people around him, including his colleagues, looked at him with a certain level of respect and admiration. He was convinced that the watch was the magical talisman bringing him all the recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the unforeseen soon occurred. One afternoon, as Jack was winding his watch, it suddenly stopped. He furrowed his brows, shook the timepiece, and even tried to wind it again, but to no avail. Jack took the watch to a nearby watch repair shop. There, he was met with some shocking news.\n",
      "\n",
      "The craftsman examined the watch closely, removed his magnifying glasses, and sighed heavily. The glittering watch was not made of gold; it was a mere imitation. It was worthless and unrepairable. Jack was taken aback, the harsh truth felt like a cold shower, washing away the illusion of opulence he had built around himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He returned home, his pride wounded and heart heavy. He pondered over his foolishness, his decision to invest his savings on something that seemed grand but held no real value. He had been swept away by the glitter, the superficial charm of a material object, and the hollow respect it gained him.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this bitter experience, Jack learned a vital lesson. The saying \"All that glitters is not gold\" made perfect sense to him now. He realized that appearances could be deceptive, and mere materialistic possessions do not define success or respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The incident left Jack more mature, wiser, and more focused on his path. He decided not to get distracted by materialistic illusions anymore. Instead, he would invest his time and effort in nurturing his skills, growing as a businessman, and building authentic relationships based on respect and shared values rather than ostentatious appearances.\n",
      "\n",
      "This invaluable lesson that Jack learned that day stayed with him throughout his life, shaping his decisions and guiding him in his path towards real success. He finally understood that all that glitters is indeed not gold. It is the person we are and the values we uphold that truly glitter and carry a golden worth.\n",
      "C. Once upon a time in a small town lived a young woman, Emma, with an insatiable curiosity about the lives of the royals. The grandeur of the castles, shimmering crowns, lavish feasts, and endless ceremonies intrigued her, painting a picture of glamour and fun in her mind. She would often remark, \"Oh, how I wish I could trade my boring life with theirs!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, fate played its part and Emma was magically transformed into a princess. Delighted, she relished in the splendor of her new life. She bathed in milk and honey, dressed in silk gowns and jewels, and attended grand ceremonies. From afar, Emma's life seemed like a dream come true, a fairy tale brought to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, as time passed, the glamour started to fade. She realized her every move was observed, every word measured, every action scrutinized. She felt like she was living in a gilded cage, pretty to look at but bound and confined. Privacy was a luxury she had traded off for her royal status. Her heart longed for the simplicity and freedom she had once enjoyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She yearned for days when she could walk through the meadows, without guards trailing behind her, or have an honest conversation without the fear of a scandal. Tucking into her bed alone at night, in the enormous palace, she realized she was lonelier than ever. The endless protocol and duties, the fake smiles she had to put on at every public event, the immense pressure to always look perfect and composed; it was all overwhelming.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, she was informed of a grand ball being organized in her honor. The castle was filled with chatter, laughs, and music, but Emma felt a strange solitude amidst the crowd. As she danced with dukes and diplomats, she dreamt of the tiny cottage in her hometown, her simple bed, her friends, and her freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, she felt a lump in her throat. She excused herself, fleeing the ballroom in tears. She ran to her royal chambers, locked the door, and finally allowed herself to break down. She had never felt more isolated and trapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma now understood that the life of royals, though looks glamorous from afar, was not as happy and fun as it seemed. The luxurious life came with a hefty price - her freedom, her privacy, and her happiness. It was a beautiful illusion that hid the ugly truth beneath its golden veils.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, Emma learned a valuable lesson. She realized that true happiness lies not in glittering crowns and grand palaces, but in freedom and love. Although it took a hard lesson, she was content knowing that her humble life, away from the royal glamour, was more fulfilling and joyful. And from then on, she never yearned for the life of royals again, understanding it was not as carefree and delightful as it had seemed from afar.\n",
      "D. Although he may appear as an ordinary man, don't let his clothes fool you. He isn't one to wear flashy designer clothes or adorn himself with the latest accessories. You won't see him draped in Gucci, nor would you find him in Louis Vuitton. His outfits, while always clean and neat, are decidedly simple, often lacking even a brand logo.

      "A.  John had been born into a well-to-do family, inheriting a fortune so large that it was often incomprehensible even to him. He owned luxurious penthouses in cities renowned for their exuberance and affluent life. The company he inherited from his father was a multi-billion-dollar business empire, earning him the title of a billionaire. John, it seemed, was an epitome of prosperity and success. And while many looked at his life with a tinge of green in their eyes, everyone envied his wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "John's life was extravagant, filled with parties, fast cars, and the finest of wines. His dinners consisted of the rarest delicacies catered by celebrity chefs, and his holidays were in the most sought-after tourist destinations. His days were filled with business, while his nights were filled with entertaining high-profile guests. John was living the proverbial dream, or so it seemed to those looking from the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite such a luxurious life and seemingly endless wealth, he yearned for something else. Every time he looked at his reflection in the gold-framed mirror, he couldn't help but feel a pang of loneliness. John was surrounded by people, by admirers, by business partners, but he felt utterly alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike most, John's problems didn't revolve around money; instead, they revolved around the gaping void in his life, void that his wealth couldn't fill. He had no true friends, no family, and no one who genuinely cared for him beyond his fortunes. He had no one to share his victories with, no one to lean on during his failures. His riches were a magnet that attracted the people around him, but his heart yearned for a connection that was more human and less materialistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the sun set behind his luxury yacht, he stood there, a solitary figure amidst a sea of opulence. He had everything that money could buy, but he yearned for that which money couldn't afford - companionship, genuine relationships, and true love. He realized that despite being one of the richest men in the world, he felt poor. Poor in affection, poor in companionship, poor in all the aspects that made life worth living.\n",
      "\n",
      "John's wealth was a blessing and a curse. It attracted envy, but also isolation. He was rich beyond measure, but was a destitute in matters of the heart. He was living a life many could only dream of, yet his heart was crying out in solitude. John was a man surrounded by people, yet he was utterly alone.\n",

      "B.  Once upon a time, in the busy city of New York, a young man named Jack lived a life of simple contentment. Jack was a small town lad, who had moved to the bustling city in pursuit of his dreams. He had always aspired to be a successful businessman, undeterred by the amount of hard work and dedication it would require.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, he walked past a bustling storefront, its window glittering with a display of shiny trinkets. Among them was an ornate golden watch, its lustrous appeal drawing Jack towards it. Being an ambitious man, Jack thought that possessing the golden watch would give him an essence of opulence and success. Ignoring his meager savings, he walked into the shop and purchased the beautiful timepiece.\n",
      "\n",
      "Days turned into weeks, and Jack flaited the golden watch proudly. He noticed that people around him, including his colleagues, looked at him with a certain level of respect and admiration. He was convinced that the watch was the magical talisman bringing him all the recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the unforeseen soon occurred. One afternoon, as Jack was winding his watch, it suddenly stopped. He furrowed his brows, shook the timepiece, and even tried to wind it again, but to no avail. Jack took the watch to a nearby watch repair shop. There, he was met with some shocking news.\n",
      "\n",
      "The craftsman examined the watch closely, removed his magnifying glasses, and sighed heavily. The glittering watch was not made of gold; it was a mere imitation. It was worthless and unrepairable. Jack was taken aback, the harsh truth felt like a cold shower, washing away the illusion of opulence he had built around himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He returned home, his pride wounded and heart heavy. He pondered over his foolishness, his decision to invest his savings on something that seemed grand but held no real value. He had been swept away by the glitter, the superficial charm of a material object, and the hollow respect it gained him.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this bitter experience, Jack learned a vital lesson. The saying \"All that glitters is not gold\" made perfect sense to him now. He realized that appearances could be deceptive, and mere materialistic possessions do not define success or respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The incident left Jack more mature, wiser, and more focused on his path. He decided not to get distracted by materialistic illusions anymore. Instead, he would invest his time and effort in nurturing his skills, growing as a businessman, and building authentic relationships based on respect and shared values rather than ostentatious appearances.\n",
      "\n",
      "This invaluable lesson that Jack learned that day stayed with him throughout his life, shaping his decisions and guiding him in his path towards real success. He finally understood that all that glitters is indeed not gold. It is the person we are and the values we uphold that truly glitter and carry a golden worth.\n",

Each corner boasted unique shops, each alleyway teemed with secrets waiting to be discovered. It was like being a part of a dynamic, pulsating organism, forever evolving and adapting.\\n\\nBut beneath this awe and wonder, she felt the pressure, the stress, and the undeniable struggle. She missed her home in London, the comfort of familiarity, the warmth of loved ones. She craved for a simple cup of tea at her favorite café, yearned to hear the chime of Big Ben, and felt a profound longing for her friends and family.\\n\\nTrisha moved to Japan in the hope of a better career opportunity.

Interacting with her co-workers, dealing with bureaucracy, even ordering food from a menu, became a struggle.\\n\\nCulture shock was another difficult beast to tame. The Japanese work ethic, the customs, the traditions, were all new to her. She had to constantly remind herself to be polite, patient, and persevering, even when she felt frustrated and lost.\\n\\nShe would often find herself crying at the end of the day, exhausted physically and emotionally. The fun had faded, replaced by the grim reality of her struggles. But in these moments, she realized, it was important to count her blessings.\\n\\nShe was in Japan, a country she had always admired from afar. She was working for an anime studio, living out her dream. She had an apartment, a job, food on the table, and supportive friends back home.\\n\\nLife was tough, sure, but she was tougher.

She was dirty and her clothes were in tatters. Everyone around, frightened by her appearance, scuttled past her as if she was a plague. But Jason wasn't one to judge people based on appearances alone; he knew that appearances could be deceptive.\\n\\nInstead, he approached the scared little girl, covered her with his warm coat, and gently coaxed her to come with him to the shelter. He then cleaned her up, fed her a warm meal and offered her a safe place to stay. When Lucy looked into his eyes, she did not see a frightening muscular man, she saw a kind soul reaching out to her.\\n\\nWord soon spread around town about Jason's good deeds. People began to see him in a new light and realized they had wrongly judged him. This shift in perception served as a lesson for everyone in town: don't judge people based on appearances alone; appearances can be deceptive.\\n\\nAs for Lucy, she started to flourish under Jason's care. She learned to read and write, grew strong and healthy, and went on to become a social worker to help others like her. She, too, remembered the lesson she had learned from Jason and taught others the same.\\n\\nShe shared her story with everyone she met, emphasizing the importance of not judging people based on their appearances.

As for Jason, he continued his humble life, always reminding people that the outer shell doesn't reflect what's inside the heart.\\n\\nIn the end, the town learned a valuable life lesson.

At first glance, she may seem like an airhead, with her bubble gum pink hair, clothes that could only be described as eccentric, and her constant giggle that never seemed to end. It was all too easy to dismiss her, categorize her under \"dumb blonde\", and move on. And that is precisely what most people did.\\n\\nBut as I got to know Lexi, I began to realize how superficial that perception was. Despite her seemingly shallow exterior, she proved to be one of the wisest people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.

One of our friends, Kate, was having difficulty deciding whether to break up with her boyfriend. Most of our friends opted for the usual platitudes, encouraging Kate to follow her heart.\\n\\nThen Lexi spoke up. At first, there was a lull in the conversation as everyone turned to look at her. I think, in part, they were curious about what advice Lexi, with her glittery pink eye-shadow and bubblegum-scented lip-gloss, could possibly offer.\\n\\nWithout any hesitation, Lexi said, \"Fear of being alone should never be the foundation of a relationship.\" She followed it up by explaining that it was far more important to find happiness within oneself before seeking it in another.\\n\\nThere was a stunned silence as everyone absorbed Lexi\\'s words. I remember Kate\\'s eyes glistening with unshed tears, moved by Lexi\\'s wisdom. From that day forward, no one underestimated Lexi again. Not when she spoke about personal growth, not when she offered her views on world politics, and certainly not when she solved an algebra equation faster than anyone in class.\\n\\nFrom then on, whenever I saw Lexi in her technicolor outfits, giggling at her own jokes, I saw more than an airhead. I saw a young woman wise beyond her years, bravely defying societal stereotypes. I found myself constantly admiring Lexi, not just for her wisdom but also for her courage to be herself.\\n\\nAll in all, Lexi taught me an invaluable lesson about appearances and judgments.

Intrigued by the rumors of this magnificent rose garden, he decided to pay a visit. Mary, with her ever-beaming smile, welcomed him and proudly led him to her garden, boasting of each rose like they were her children.\\n\\nAs the man walked around, he noted that while Mary’s garden was indeed beautiful, it was not exceptional. The roses were just regular species, nothing rare or unique, and there were several other gardens in the city that were far more impressive. However, he chose not to burst Mary\\'s bubble and appreciated her garden with polite enthusiasm.\\n\\nMonths passed and Mary continued to boast about her garden, convincing even the skeptics with her unwavering confidence. She saw her garden not as it was, but through a lens of love and pride, which made her garden the most beautiful in her eyes.\\n\\nEvery day, Mary woke up early to nurture her garden, taking care of each plant as if it were her own child. Her dedication was undeniable, and even though her garden was ordinary by all means, it was the best garden in the city to her.\\n\\nRegardless of the reality, Mary\\'s rose garden was her sanctuary, her paradise. It was there where she felt happiest, tending to her ordinary roses. To her, each petal, each leaf was a marvel. And in that respect, maybe her rose garden was indeed the best garden in the city. After all, the beauty of a garden isn’t just in its plants, but also in the love and care bestowed upon them.\\n',\n",
       " \" John had been born into a well-to-do family, inheriting a fortune so large that it was often incomprehensible even to him. He owned luxurious penthouses in cities renowned for their exuberance and affluent life. The company he inherited from his father was a multi-billion-dollar business empire, earning him the title of a billionaire. John, it seemed, was an epitome of prosperity and success. And while many looked at his life with a tinge of green in their eyes, everyone envied his wealth.\\n\\nJohn's life was extravagant, filled with parties, fast cars, and the finest of wines. His dinners consisted of the rarest delicacies catered by celebrity chefs, and his holidays were in the most sought-after tourist destinations. His days were filled with business, while his nights were filled with entertaining high-profile guests. John was living the proverbial dream, or so it seemed to those looking from the outside.\\n\\nDespite such a luxurious life and seemingly endless wealth, he yearned for something else. Every time he looked at his reflection in the gold-framed mirror, he couldn't help but feel a pang of loneliness. John was surrounded by people, by admirers, by business partners, but he felt utterly alone.\\n\\nUnlike most, John's problems didn't revolve around money; instead, they revolved around the gaping void in his life, void that his wealth couldn't fill. He had no true friends, no family, and no one who genuinely cared for him beyond his fortunes. He had no one to share his victories with, no one to lean on during his failures. His riches were a magnet that attracted the people around him, but his heart yearned for a connection that was more human and less materialistic.\\n\\nAs the sun set behind his luxury yacht, he stood there, a solitary figure amidst a sea of opulence. He had everything that money could buy, but he yearned for that which money couldn't afford - companionship, genuine relationships, and true love. He realized that despite being one of the richest men in the world, he felt poor. Poor in affection, poor in companionship, poor in all the aspects that made life worth living.\\n\\nJohn's wealth was a blessing and a curse. It attracted envy, but also isolation. He was rich beyond measure, but was a destitute in matters of the heart. He was living a life many could only dream of, yet his heart was crying out in solitude. John was a man surrounded by people, yet he was utterly alone.\",\n",
       " \" She had always been captivated by the facade of her neighbor's home. Every time she left her house and turned to look at it, she couldn't help but admire its striking elegance. It was painted in a tasteful shade of lavender, adorned with well-crafted wooden shutters and surrounded by a beautiful manicured garden full of vibrant flowers and lush greenery. Her house, on the other hand, was simple and plain.\\n\\nIts charm had been muted by years of weathering. The paint peeled away in places, the lawn was unkempt, and a few shingles were missing from the roof. Every time she looked at her neighbor's house, she was filled with a sense of longing and a bit of envy. She thought her neighbor's home was more attractive than her own, and she wished for the same level of beauty.\\n\\nHowever, what she didn't realize was the amount of effort her neighbor invested to maintain the appeal of her home. The immaculate garden required daily watering, pruning, and weeding. The lavender paint needed touching up every couple of years, and the wooden shutters had to be refinished to protect them from the elements. The neighbor spent endless hours and a considerable amount of money to keep the house looking its best.\\n\\nOne day, she casually mentioned her admiration for the neighbor's home while they were both picking up their mail. She complimented the neighbor's impeccable taste and expressed her desire to emulate the same for her own home.\\n\\nThe neighbor smiled graciously and thanked her for the compliments. However, she also mentioned the intensive upkeep and constant attention her house demanded. She talked about the sweat-soaked weekends spent trimming hedges, the painstaking process of picking out the perfect shade of lavender paint, and the ongoing battles with pests determined to ruin her garden.\\n\\nHer words brought her an unexpected revelation. She had been so blinded by the allure of the neighbor's house that she had failed to consider the effort it took to keep it that way. She thought back to her own home, simple as it was, and realized its maintenance was hardly as demanding.\\n\\nIn hindsight, her plain, low-maintenance house suddenly felt more comforting. It was her home, filled with warmth, peace, and memories, and it required just enough upkeep to stay functional and cozy. It didn't demand her constant attention or drain her energy like her neighbor's high-maintenance home.\\n\\nShe still admired her neighbor's house for its aesthetic appeal, but no longer felt the same sense of longing and envy she once did. She was now content with her own home, recognizing the hidden charm and simplicity it held. After all, a house's worth is measured not by its outward beauty, but by the comfort and happiness it provides to those who dwell within it.\\n\",\n",

But did a nagging sense of wanting more, a larger perspective of life, gnaw at me? Absolutely.\\n\\nI looked across the room towards you. You, my best friend since high school, wore the aura of someone who had seemingly found a deeper sense of contentment. Your desk cluttered with papers, a warm cup of coffee in your hand and the faint hint of a smile playing on your lips while you continued working on your laptop.\\n\\nYou\\'d always been more academically inclined. I remembered how, post-college, you made a decision to further your education by pursuing your master’s degree. I, on the other hand, lured by the thought of a steady paycheck and the allure of the \"real world\", had opted to step right into the workforce.\\n\\n\"You look pensive,\" you commented, your eyes never leaving the screen.\\n\\n\"Sometimes I feel I should have gone for my master’s degree like you instead of this job,\" I confessed, the words slipping out before I could contain them.\\n\\nYou looked up at me, surprise painted on your face. \"Why would you say that?\" you asked, pushing back your chair and giving me your full attention.\\n\\n\"Well,\" I began, taking a sip of my cold coffee. \"I see you with your degrees and I see your sense of accomplishment. It just seems so...satisfying. The gratification of having learnt something new, something more.\"\\n\\nA chuckle escaped your lips as you shook your head in amusement, \"I see you, my friend, with your job, and I sometimes think I should have done that. I could\\'ve started earning earlier, gained professional experience.\"\\n\\nA warm smile spread across my face as you continued, \"I mean, it is exciting to learn and explore in academia, but sometimes the real world seems more enticing, doesn\\'t it?\"\\n\\nI chuckled, realizing the irony of our situation. Isn\\'t it interesting how human beings always crave what they don\\'t have? The grass does seem greener on the other side until we get there and see the reality.\\n\\nWe laughed heartily, understanding each other perfectly. Isn\\'t this the beauty of friendships? They hold a mirror to our thoughts, make us realize our fallacies, and add a dash of humor to our overthinking.\\n\\nNodding at your insightful words, I added, \"Well, the grass is always greener on the other side.\"\\n\\nWe clinked our coffee cups, a toast to our different paths and perspectives, a celebration of our individual decisions, acknowledging that both paths have their own value and no choice is inherently wrong or right. It\\'s all about what each of us wants from our life. Life continued in the office, and we went back to our own worlds, a bit wiser, a lot more content.',\n",
       " ' At the local soccer academy, there was a name that echoed through the training grounds, hallways, and conversations. The name was Kevin, an icon who had elevated to a god-like status among the new recruits. To them, he was infallible, unbeatable, and undeniably the best player in the game. Their blind admiration was based on a single moment - a famous goal he had scored last season. It was a breath-taking, unbelievable strike that had catapulted Kevin to instant stardom.\\n\\nKevin, however, remained elusive for the new batch, their only acquaintance with him being through his legendary tales. So, they worshipped him, waiting for the day they would meet their soccer messiah. The day arrived when the academy organized a special scrimmage game, presenting the opportunity for the newcomers to play with the senior students, the superstar Kevin included.\\n\\nAs they lined up in the academy\\'s giant soccer field, their nerves tingled with excitement and anxiety.

The game began and Kevin\\'s supporters watched him with eager eyes, anticipating the magic they had heard so much about. Yet, as the game progressed, the magic seemed lacking.\\n\\nKevin was undoubtedly good but did not seem invincible. He seemed human after all. His passes weren’t always accurate, his shots weren\\'t flawless, and he even missed a straightforward goal. The recruits watched in disbelief as their idol proved to be mortal. The famous goal that had secured Kevin\\'s place in their hearts and minds seemed to be just a lucky strike.\\n\\nWhen the game ended, the recruits were left in a whirl of confusion and disappointment. They had built Kevin to be a superhuman player, yet the reality was vastly different. The question was, had they set him on an unrealistically high pedestal?\\n\\nLater, Kevin, unaware of the disillusionment his performance had caused, approached the dejected newbies. He spoke to them about the famous goal, explaining how it was not skill but pure chance that had made it successful. He said he too was surprised when the ball had found the back of the net.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not a superstar,\" he added, laughing, \"I just had a lucky day.\"\\n\\nIn those words, they found a new respect for Kevin. He was not the unbeatable soccer god they had initially thought, but that did not make him any less admirable. Kevin was human, had his strengths and flaws, and despite all, he had still accomplished something they could only dream of. Their worship of Kevin did not diminish, rather it became more realistic and understanding.',\n",

She would often remark, \"Oh, how I wish I could trade my boring life with theirs!\"\\n\\nOne day, fate played its part and Emma was magically transformed into a princess. Delighted, she relished in the splendor of her new life. She bathed in milk and honey, dressed in silk gowns and jewels, and attended grand ceremonies. From afar, Emma\\'s life seemed like a dream come true, a fairy tale brought to life.\\n\\nHowever, as time passed, the glamour started to fade. She realized her every move was observed, every word measured, every action scrutinized. She felt like she was living in a gilded cage, pretty to look at but bound and confined. Privacy was a luxury she had traded off for her royal status. Her heart longed for the simplicity and freedom she had once enjoyed.\\n\\nShe yearned for days when she could walk through the meadows, without guards trailing behind her, or have an honest conversation without the fear of a scandal. Tucking into her bed alone at night, in the enormous palace, she realized she was lonelier than ever. The endless protocol and duties, the fake smiles she had to put on at every public event, the immense pressure to always look perfect and composed; it was all overwhelming.\\n\\nOne day, she was informed of a grand ball being organized in her honor.

As she danced with dukes and diplomats, she dreamt of the tiny cottage in her hometown, her simple bed, her friends, and her freedom.\\n\\nSuddenly, she felt a lump in her throat.

He had begun to notice the shadows lingering in the hallways of justice.\\n\\nThus, an idea began to form in Jonathan's mind, an idea that was as dangerous as it was compelling. He started to contemplate the idea of leaving the legal profession behind and pursuing an MBA. The business world beckoned him with the allure of a different kind of challenge. He thought of the strategic decisions, the operational changes, the careful handling of resources, and the thrill of leading a business to success. This idea consumed him, overshadowing his formidable legal career.\\n\\nDespite the objections from his family and friends, he applied for a sabbatical from his firm and began preparing for his entry into a top-tier business school. Countless nights of intensive study followed, culminating in his admission into one of the most renowned universities in the country.

       " \" At first glance, the life of a celebrity appears gleaming. From the sparkling red carpets they walk on to the adoring fans that clamor for their autographs, it seems like they have it all. The flash of cameras on their faces makes them shine even brighter. To many, celebrities live in a world that is not just glamorous but also carefree and full of success. Their life appears to be a dream come true, brimming with fame, fortune, and the privilege to be globally recognized and loved.\\n\\nHowever, like the old saying goes, not all that glitters is gold. Behind those glittering sequins and dazzling smiles, there lies a raw and startling reality. A reality that is often masked by the thick layers of makeup, brand endorsements, and shining golden trophies. A reality that reveals that celebrities actually face more problems than anyone can possibly imagine.\\n\\nThe incessant scrutiny by the media and fans are just the tip of the iceberg. Every aspect of their life is under public eye, their actions dissected, their words interpreted and reinterpreted, leading to rumors, controversies and public backlash. Even their personal life is often subject to speculations and scandalous headlines, stripping them off their basic human right to privacy.\\n\\nThe pressure to maintain a flawless image can become overwhelming. They are expected to always look perfect, behave impeccably, and continuously churn out impeccable work. Every mistake they make is magnified, even leading to vicious trolling and hate comments on social media.\\n\\nAnd then, there's the fierce competition within the industry. Every celebrity is on a race to stay relevant, to stay in the public eye. The constant struggle to stay on top can lead to severe stress, anxiety and even depression. Furthermore, their hectic schedule, comprising of erratic work hours, filming in harsh conditions and constant travelling can take a toll on their physical and mental health.\\n\\nTheir wealth, though abundant, often leads to legal and financial complications. It also attracts fake relationships and fair-weather friends who hang around only for their fortune. \\n\\nCelebrities also deal with loneliness. Despite being constantly surrounded by a team of people, they often have no one who truly understands their journey or their problems. It’s a sea of shallow acquaintances with very few genuine connections.\\n\\nIn truth, the life of a celebrity, though glittering, is a lonely road, riddled with troubles hidden beneath a façade of perfection. All said and done, being a celebrity is not just about the glitz and glamour, it’s a path less traveled with its own set of perks and pitfalls. And the problems they face? They're often far greater than anyone could possibly imagine.\",\n",

You won't see him draped in Gucci, nor would you find him in Louis Vuitton. His outfits, while always clean and neat, are decidedly simple, often lacking even a brand logo. The reality, however, is far removed from what his clothes might suggest. Despite his unsophisticated attire, he is actually a millionaire.\\n\\nHis name is John, and he's made a fortune in the tech industry. He is the owner of a successful start-up that revolutionized the world of communication. But, surprisingly, his lifestyle and preferences aren't what you'd expect from a self-made millionaire. He resided not in an extravagant mansion with gilded gates and marbled floors, but in a modest bungalow nestled among towering trees and chirping birds.\\n\\nHis living room didn't boast a grand piano or exquisite antique collections. Instead, it contained comfortable couches and shelves bursting with an array of books, from classic literature to the latest scientific journals. He drove a modest car, preferring its efficiency and practicality over the showy luxury models many of his peers favored.\\n\\nHe didn't frequent high-end restaurants and chic coffee shops. Rather, he enjoyed homemade meals and sipping coffee at his favorite local café. He preferred silence and serenity over the noise and chaos of swanky parties. In his eyes, the glitz and glamour of the millionaire's lifestyle were mere distractions from the simple pleasures of life.\\n\\nAt first glance, he may look like the guy-next-door, but his inconspicuous appearance is a stark contrast to his massive wealth. He purposely keeps himself underdressed. For him, his unpretentious appearance keeps him grounded, reminding him of his humble beginnings.\\n\\nHowever, this frugal facade doesn't indicate a lack of generosity. He is the silent benefactor of numerous charities and scholarship programs. He invested heavily in the education sector, contributing to the construction of schools and libraries. He sponsored countless students, who otherwise would never have had the chance to afford quality education.\\n\\nAll this philanthropy, carried out discreetly and without seeking any recognition, sets him apart. He is a millionaire not defined by the thickness of his wallet, but by the breadth of his actions. So, don't be fooled by his clothes, for beneath the humble fabric, beats the heart of a true philanthropist, a man richer in character than in currency.\",\n",

       " ' Lexi had an appearance that was deceiving. At first glance, she may seem like an airhead, with her bubble gum pink hair, clothes that could only be described as eccentric, and her constant giggle that never seemed to end. It was all too easy to dismiss her, categorize her under \"dumb blonde\", and move on. And that is precisely what most people did.\\n\\nBut as I got to know Lexi, I began to realize how superficial that perception was. Despite her seemingly shallow exterior, she proved to be one of the wisest people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. She showed depth in her thoughts and words that were nothing short of profound. \\n\\nI remember one time when a group of our friends were discussing their relationship issues. One of our friends, Kate, was having difficulty deciding whether to break up with her boyfriend. Most of our friends opted for the usual platitudes, encouraging Kate to follow her heart.\\n\\nThen Lexi spoke up. At first, there was a lull in the conversation as everyone turned to look at her. I think, in part, they were curious about what advice Lexi, with her glittery pink eye-shadow and bubblegum-scented lip-gloss, could possibly offer.\\n\\nWithout any hesitation, Lexi said, \"Fear of being alone should never be the foundation of a relationship.\" She followed it up by explaining that it was far more important to find happiness within oneself before seeking it in another.\\n\\nThere was a stunned silence as everyone absorbed Lexi\\'s words. I remember Kate\\'s eyes glistening with unshed tears, moved by Lexi\\'s wisdom. From that day forward, no one underestimated Lexi again. Not when she spoke about personal growth, not when she offered her views on world politics, and certainly not when she solved an algebra equation faster than anyone in class.\\n\\nFrom then on, whenever I saw Lexi in her technicolor outfits, giggling at her own jokes, I saw more than an airhead. I saw a young woman wise beyond her years, bravely defying societal stereotypes. I found myself constantly admiring Lexi, not just for her wisdom but also for her courage to be herself.\\n\\nAll in all, Lexi taught me an invaluable lesson about appearances and judgments. Despite her flamboyant exterior, she held a wisdom that was rare and beautiful. Although Lexi looked like an airhead, she was one of the wisest people I had ever met, and I was proud to call her my friend.\\n',\n",

       " ' Working in a busy corporate office, pushing papers day in and day out, I couldn\\'t help but sometimes ponder about the choices I had made in my life. Was I satisfied? Yes. But did a nagging sense of wanting more, a larger perspective of life, gnaw at me? Absolutely.\\n\\nI looked across the room towards you. You, my best friend since high school, wore the aura of someone who had seemingly found a deeper sense of contentment. Your desk cluttered with papers, a warm cup of coffee in your hand and the faint hint of a smile playing on your lips while you continued working on your laptop.\\n\\nYou\\'d always been more academically inclined. I remembered how, post-college, you made a decision to further your education by pursuing your master’s degree. I, on the other hand, lured by the thought of a steady paycheck and the allure of the \"real world\", had opted to step right into the workforce.\\n\\n\"You look pensive,\" you commented, your eyes never leaving the screen.\\n\\n\"Sometimes I feel I should have gone for my master’s degree like you instead of this job,\" I confessed, the words slipping out before I could contain them.\\n\\nYou looked up at me, surprise painted on your face. \"Why would you say that?\" you asked, pushing back your chair and giving me your full attention.\\n\\n\"Well,\" I began, taking a sip of my cold coffee. \"I see you with your degrees and I see your sense of accomplishment. It just seems so...satisfying. The gratification of having learnt something new, something more.\"\\n\\nA chuckle escaped your lips as you shook your head in amusement, \"I see you, my friend, with your job, and I sometimes think I should have done that. I could\\'ve started earning earlier, gained professional experience.\"\\n\\nA warm smile spread across my face as you continued, \"I mean, it is exciting to learn and explore in academia, but sometimes the real world seems more enticing, doesn\\'t it?\"\\n\\nI chuckled, realizing the irony of our situation. Isn\\'t it interesting how human beings always crave what they don\\'t have? The grass does seem greener on the other side until we get there and see the reality.\\n\\nWe laughed heartily, understanding each other perfectly. Isn\\'t this the beauty of friendships? They hold a mirror to our thoughts, make us realize our fallacies, and add a dash of humor to our overthinking.\\n\\nNodding at your insightful words, I added, \"Well, the grass is always greener on the other side.\"\\n\\nWe clinked our coffee cups, a toast to our different paths and perspectives, a celebration of our individual decisions, acknowledging that both paths have their own value and no choice is inherently wrong or right. It\\'s all about what each of us wants from our life. Life continued in the office, and we went back to our own worlds, a bit wiser, a lot more content.\\n',\n",
       " \" At first glance, the life of a celebrity appears gleaming. From the sparkling red carpets they walk on to the adoring fans that clamor for their autographs, it seems like they have it all. The flash of cameras on their faces makes them shine even brighter. To many, celebrities live in a world that is not just glamorous but also carefree and full of success. Their life appears to be a dream come true, brimming with fame, fortune, and the privilege to be globally recognized and loved.\\n\\nHowever, like the old saying goes, not all that glitters is gold. Behind those glittering sequins and dazzling smiles, there lies a raw and startling reality. A reality that is often masked by the thick layers of makeup, brand endorsements, and shining golden trophies. A reality that reveals that celebrities actually face more problems than anyone can possibly imagine.\\n\\nThe incessant scrutiny by the media and fans are just the tip of the iceberg. Every aspect of their life is under public eye, their actions dissected, their words interpreted and reinterpreted, leading to rumors, controversies and public backlash. Even their personal life is often subject to speculations and scandalous headlines, stripping them off their basic human right to privacy.\\n\\nThe pressure to maintain a flawless image can become overwhelming. They are expected to always look perfect, behave impeccably, and continuously churn out impeccable work. Every mistake they make is magnified, even leading to vicious trolling and hate comments on social media.\\n\\nAnd then, there's the fierce competition within the industry. Every celebrity is on a race to stay relevant, to stay in the public eye. The constant struggle to stay on top can lead to severe stress, anxiety and even depression. Furthermore, their hectic schedule, comprising of erratic work hours, filming in harsh conditions and constant travelling can take a toll on their physical and mental health.\\n\\nTheir wealth, though abundant, often leads to legal and financial complications. It also attracts fake relationships and fair-weather friends who hang around only for their fortune. \\n\\nCelebrities also deal with loneliness. Despite being constantly surrounded by a team of people, they often have no one who truly understands their journey or their problems. It’s a sea of shallow acquaintances with very few genuine connections.\\n\\nIn truth, the life of a celebrity, though glittering, is a lonely road, riddled with troubles hidden beneath a façade of perfection. All said and done, being a celebrity is not just about the glitz and glamour, it’s a path less traveled with its own set of perks and pitfalls. And the problems they face? They're often far greater than anyone could possibly imagine.\\n\",\n",

Nearly every day, Mary would boast about the wonder and grandeur of her rose garden, claiming it to be the best in the entire city. She would invite friends, neighbors, and sometimes even strangers to come and admire her exquisite collection of roses.\\n\\nHer garden was indeed pretty, filled with a colorful assortment of roses, but it was certainly nothing extraordinary. The roses were typical varieties, the types that could be found in any other garden in the city. Yet, Mary\\'s enthusiasm about her garden was infectious, and many people were drawn in by her vibrant claims.\\n\\nMary was known for throwing lavish parties, where the highlight was a tour of her precious rose garden. She would stride around, her chest puffed up with pride, pointing out the different types of roses she had cultivated. \"This here,\" she would say, \"is the rarest and most expensive rose in the city,\" pointing to an ordinary red rose.\\n\\nOne day, a man from the city’s gardening association happened to pass by Mary’s house. Intrigued by the rumors of this magnificent rose garden, he decided to pay a visit. Mary, with her ever-beaming smile, welcomed him and proudly led him to her garden, boasting of each rose like they were her children.\\n\\nAs the man walked around, he noted that while Mary’s garden was indeed beautiful, it was not exceptional. The roses were just regular species, nothing rare or unique, and there were several other gardens in the city that were far more impressive. However, he chose not to burst Mary\\'s bubble and appreciated her garden with polite enthusiasm.\\n\\nMonths passed and Mary continued to boast about her garden, convincing even the skeptics with her unwavering confidence. She saw her garden not as it was, but through a lens of love and pride, which made her garden the most beautiful in her eyes.\\n\\nEvery day, Mary woke up early to nurture her garden, taking care of each plant as if it were her own child. Her dedication was undeniable, and even though her garden was ordinary by all means, it was the best garden in the city to her.\\n\\nRegardless of the reality, Mary\\'s rose garden was her sanctuary, her paradise. It was there where she felt happiest, tending to her ordinary roses. To her, each petal, each leaf was a marvel. And in that respect, maybe her rose garden was indeed the best garden in the city.

       " \" She had always been captivated by the facade of her neighbor's home. Every time she left her house and turned to look at it, she couldn't help but admire its striking elegance. It was painted in a tasteful shade of lavender, adorned with well-crafted wooden shutters and surrounded by a beautiful manicured garden full of vibrant flowers and lush greenery. Her house, on the other hand, was simple and plain.\\n\\nIts charm had been muted by years of weathering. The paint peeled away in places, the lawn was unkempt, and a few shingles were missing from the roof. Every time she looked at her neighbor's house, she was filled with a sense of longing and a bit of envy. She thought her neighbor's home was more attractive than her own, and she wished for the same level of beauty.\\n\\nHowever, what she didn't realize was the amount of effort her neighbor invested to maintain the appeal of her home. The immaculate garden required daily watering, pruning, and weeding. The lavender paint needed touching up every couple of years, and the wooden shutters had to be refinished to protect them from the elements. The neighbor spent endless hours and a considerable amount of money to keep the house looking its best.\\n\\nOne day, she casually mentioned her admiration for the neighbor's home while they were both picking up their mail. She complimented the neighbor's impeccable taste and expressed her desire to emulate the same for her own home.\\n\\nThe neighbor smiled graciously and thanked her for the compliments. However, she also mentioned the intensive upkeep and constant attention her house demanded. She talked about the sweat-soaked weekends spent trimming hedges, the painstaking process of picking out the perfect shade of lavender paint, and the ongoing battles with pests determined to ruin her garden.\\n\\nHer words brought her an unexpected revelation. She had been so blinded by the allure of the neighbor's house that she had failed to consider the effort it took to keep it that way. She thought back to her own home, simple as it was, and realized its maintenance was hardly as demanding.\\n\\nIn hindsight, her plain, low-maintenance house suddenly felt more comforting. It was her home, filled with warmth, peace, and memories, and it required just enough upkeep to stay functional and cozy. It didn't demand her constant attention or drain her energy like her neighbor's high-maintenance home.\\n\\nShe still admired her neighbor's house for its aesthetic appeal, but no longer felt the same sense of longing and envy she once did. She was now content with her own home, recognizing the hidden charm and simplicity it held. After all, a house's worth is measured not by its outward beauty, but by the comfort and happiness it provides to those who dwell within it.\",\n",

The reality, however, is far removed from what his clothes might suggest. Despite his unsophisticated attire, he is actually a millionaire.\\n\\nHis name is John, and he's made a fortune in the tech industry. He is the owner of a successful start-up that revolutionized the world of communication. But, surprisingly, his lifestyle and preferences aren't what you'd expect from a self-made millionaire. He resided not in an extravagant mansion with gilded gates and marbled floors, but in a modest bungalow nestled among towering trees and chirping birds.\\n\\nHis living room didn't boast a grand piano or exquisite antique collections. Instead, it contained comfortable couches and shelves bursting with an array of books, from classic literature to the latest scientific journals. He drove a modest car, preferring its efficiency and practicality over the showy luxury models many of his peers favored.\\n\\nHe didn't frequent high-end restaurants and chic coffee shops. Rather, he enjoyed homemade meals and sipping coffee at his favorite local café. He preferred silence and serenity over the noise and chaos of swanky parties. In his eyes, the glitz and glamour of the millionaire's lifestyle were mere distractions from the simple pleasures of life.\\n\\nAt first glance, he may look like the guy-next-door, but his inconspicuous appearance is a stark contrast to his massive wealth. He purposely keeps himself underdressed. For him, his unpretentious appearance keeps him grounded, reminding him of his humble beginnings.\\n\\nHowever, this frugal facade doesn't indicate a lack of generosity. He is the silent benefactor of numerous charities and scholarship programs. He invested heavily in the education sector, contributing to the construction of schools and libraries. He sponsored countless students, who otherwise would never have had the chance to afford quality education.\\n\\nAll this philanthropy, carried out discreetly and without seeking any recognition, sets him apart. He is a millionaire not defined by the thickness of his wallet, but by the breadth of his actions. So, don't be fooled by his clothes, for beneath the humble fabric, beats the heart of a true philanthropist, a man richer in character than in currency.\\n\",\n",

Their blind admiration was based on a single moment - a famous goal he had scored last season. It was a breath-taking, unbelievable strike that had catapulted Kevin to instant stardom.\\n\\nKevin, however, remained elusive for the new batch, their only acquaintance with him being through his legendary tales.

       " ' Once upon a time in a town called Sanford, lived a teenage girl named Jenny. She was a high-spirited girl, full of life, but was often found engrossed in her smartphone. She was infatuated with the world of social media; an enticing platform that revealed a multitude of lifestyles she yearned to emulate. \\n\\nShe marveled at the fun-filled pictures of her friends and celebrities, seemingly always having the time of their lives. Posh parties, exotic vacations, perfect relationships, and endless laughter were the usual feed on her social media accounts. Everyone seemed to be living a fairy tale life that she only dreamed of. It left her feeling like she was missing out, that her life wasn\\'t as exciting or glamorous.\\n\\nOne day, her mother noticed Jenny\\'s constant state of discontent. \"Don\\'t trust everything on the social media, Jenny,\" her mother warned her. \"It appears that people are having the best time of their lives, but remember, it can be fake.\"\\n\\nJenny didn\\'t heed her mother\\'s advice. She thought her mother couldn\\'t understand the young generation\\'s lifestyle. She continued scrolling through her social media feeds, yearning for a life filled with endless adventure and joy.\\n\\nOne day, her school announced a grand reunion party. Jenny was excited as she knew this was her chance to experience the glamorous life she witnessed on social media daily. She prepared for days, fantasizing about the fun she would have, which she would then share on her profiles.\\n\\nFinally, the day arrived. The party venue was embellished beautifully, and her friends arrived in designer clothes, looking like they stepped out of a magazine. Everyone was busy capturing moments on their smartphones rather than actually living them. Jenny, too, did the same. She danced, clicked pictures, laughed, but all for the camera.\\n\\nAt the end of the night, as she scrolled through her phone, the pictures painted a colorful portrait of happiness and enjoyment.

       " \" Stephen Hammond, a seasoned journalist for the prestigious New York Times, had always held an intrigue towards the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. One particular actress who had always caught his eye was Lila Day, a prodigious actress whose life seemed more than extraordinary from the outside. Her talent was immeasurable and her fame, incalculable. It seemed she possessed everything anyone could ever wish for.\\n\\nIn the lavish parties he had attended, Lila was always the center of attention, surrounded by a throng of admirers. Her laughter could be heard echoing in the gilded halls, her smile brightening up every photograph she graced. On the surface, her life seemed like a whirlwind of dazzling lights, champagne, and applause. This apparent spectacle of grandeur lured Stephen into believing Lila led an extraordinary life.\\n\\nSeeking to uncover the secrets of this alluring world, Stephen decided to pen a feature on Lila Day, to reveal the life of a superstar to the world. He embarked on his journey, filled with anticipation for unearthing exciting truths. As a journalist, he was prepared to uncover the facts beneath the glamour and the glitz.\\n\\nDays turned into weeks as he followed Lila, interviewing her closest confidantes, attending her parties, and even spending a day on the set of her latest movie. He was mesmerized by her captivating on-screen presence and her ability to sway an audience.\\n\\nHowever, the more he delved into Lila's life, the more he started seeing the cracks in the glamourous facade. Away from the flashbulbs, Lila's life was marred with a sadness that was hard to ignore. The constant scrutiny and the relentless pressure to remain on top were taking their toll on her.\\n\\nHe noticed that she was often alone, even in rooms filled with people. The ever-present smile seemed strained at times, the laughter didn't quite reach her eyes, and there was a perpetual exhaustion that hung about her. Lila was always under the public's watchful gaze, unable to relax or have any moment of solitude. Her life seemed to be filled with unending obligations and commitments.\\n\\nAs Stephen discovered more about her, he began to comprehend that being a famous actress was not just about the glamorous parties and adulation. There were sacrifices, compromises, and immense stress accompanying the fame and success.\\n\\nHis assumptions about Lila's extraordinary life shattered as he realized how tough it was to always be in the spotlight. Lila's life was a far cry from what it looked like on the outside. It was a life lived under constant pressure to perform and please.\\n\\nIn the end, Stephen wrote a piece not about a glamorous superstar, but about a human being with dreams, struggles, and vulnerabilities. His understanding of Lila's life brought depth to his work, turning it into a heartfelt exploration of the cost of fame. Stephen had thought the life of Lila Day was extraordinary, but he later realized it was not quite what it looked like.\\n\"]"
